A traveler about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door stretching himself.
He asked him sharply: "Why do you stand there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly." 
The Dog, wagging his tail, replied: "O, master! I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting." 
The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.

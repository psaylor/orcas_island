A young Thrush who lived in an orchard once became acquainted with a Swallow. 
A friendship sprang up between them; 
and the Swallow, after skimming the orchard and the neighboring meadow, would every now and then, come and visit the Thrush. 
The Thrush, hopping from branch to branch, would welcome him with his most cheerful note. 
"O mother!" said he to his parent one day, "never had creature such a friend as I have in this same Swallow."
"Nor ever any mother," replied the bird parent, "such a silly son I have in this same Thrush." 
"Long before the approach of winter, your friend will have left you; and while you sit shivering on a leafless bough he will be sporting under a sunny sky hundreds of miles away."
